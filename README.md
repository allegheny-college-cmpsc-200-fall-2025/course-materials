## Syllabus

> Computer hardware must exist, or at least be claimed to exist, before programmers can 
> even envision software for it. Just as cave dwellers didn’t squat with their flint tools 
> chipping out parking brake assemblies for 1967 Buicks, so programmers don’t write software 
> that has no computer upon which to run.

### Canonical course description

A study of the low-level operation of computer systems. Participating in hands-on activities that 
often require teamwork, students investigate how computers process instructions in modern computers 
as information is encoded, stored, and executed in a machine’s physical structures. In addition to 
learning how to program in assembly and machine languages, students investigate the design and logical 
operation of processors and the mathematics of machine computation. During a weekly laboratory session, 
students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both 
written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved 
laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

### Learning objectives

* Explain how programs written in high-level computer programming languages execute using lower-level computer circuitry
* Identify levels of the Memory Hierarchy and the implications of using the various levels to implement high-performance programs
* Develop C and Assembly language programs which use the appropriate levels of the Memory Hierarchy and processor registers to create performant, executable programs and arithmetic logic units
* Describe and use parallel processing techniques to increase a program’s performance and efficiency
* Integrate hardware and software components using original C and Assembly language code to develop hardware-based, performant computational projects

### Required materials

#### Textbook

This course does not use a standard textbook. Any additional materials required for the course will be provided by the instructor.

#### Platforms

Our work relies on your regular use of:

* [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)

#### Hardware

Learning objectives revolve around using common hardware to provide a uniform platform for students. Over the course of the semester, 
you will be provided with three hardware platforms which we will use to complete activities and assignments:

* an assortment of integrated circuits and other parts
* the [PaperPC](https://github.com/Paperdyne/PaperPC)
* the Raspberry Pi Pico W

Assignments will require use of any devices provided and evaluation will be benchmarked to performance on hardware systems, 
_not necessarily personal computers (PCs)_. While you will use your PCs to program the devices, part of our work this semester 
is to understand the limitations and opportunities of environments which require understanding standard physical system 
topology and performance.

The above statement implies that this hardware, when distributed, is as essential to bring to and prepare for class sessions 
as if it were our textbook and course platforms.

### Governance and evaluation

This course's evaluation, participation and, eventually, grades, are governed by the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This, however, does not abrogate the role of this syllabus document. Provisions here work together with the contract. 
You should consider the information provided here the basic "givens" of the course.

#### Assignments

All course assignments are assigned and evaluated using the GitHub platform. Your instructor will only assess work reposited there. 

#### Course project

The end-of-semester course project offers a choice: either a hardware- or software-rooted project aimed at exploring
course concepts beyond their in-class representations. In the closing weeks of the semester, your interest in this
project must be expressed in the form of a proposal. This proposal should contain an outline of the concept you
wish to pursue further as well as the key values or principles it tests or extends. The proposal will include several
unexclusive suggestions to give you a start.

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from instructional staff. To meet 
with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with instructors or TLs early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) 
or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let your instructor know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. Students who don't communicate issues often find themselves in preventable no-win situations. 

*It is part of your instructor's job* to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to communicate anything your instructor can do 
with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, be reminded—__**it is part of your instructor's job**__ 
to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Special needs and disability

Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course are encouraged to contact Disability Services at `+1 814-334-2898`. 
Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons, located in Pelletier Library. Should you need accommodations, contact this office as 
soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are communicated and implemented as quickly as possible. This serves both you and me 
in providing the best environment for learning and support.
